The Allaire Database Component Framework (DCF) is a collection of Java&#153; classes 
that provide a simple interface for reading and requesting database records into a Java applet 
or application. The data collection mechanisms of the DCF allow customers to connect DCF-aware 
components together with Cold Fusion&#153 and other Web technologies to create sophisticated Web 
services without the hassle of low-level programming. In addition, the library is an open 
standard for third-party software developers to build stand-alone, Cold Fusion-enabled Java 
applets quickly. 
<P>

This reference is intended for software developers who want to use the Allaire Database 
Component Framework in their own applets. Familiarity with Java is assumed. If you aren't a 
Java programmer there are many places on the Web devoted to it. 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/tutorial/index.html">Sun's Java Tutorial</A> is one of them.
<P><BR>

<B>Installation</B><BR>
The Allaire DCF library contains a framework for retrieving recordsets 
from the web server and for operations with recordsets. All Allaire 
applets use the framework, so it is necessary to install it in the 
public web server directory. Mapping to this directory is usually 
named "/classes/" and contains all Java components necessary for 
serving applets. If you do not have this directory, create the 
sub-directory "classes" in your web server’s root document directory. 
If you want to install Java components in a different directory, map 
"/classes/" to this directory and insure that the web server has access 
to it. If your server is serving multiple domains you must map 
"/classes/" for each domain which will use Java applets.
<P>

Unzip files from the dcf.zip file into the directory described above, 
using the -d switch to restore the directory structure. 
Note that some older unzipping utilities will strip the names of the 
classes from ".class" to ".cla". If this happens the applets will 
not work. Make sure they unzip with the full ".class", or rename all 
the classes after they have unzipped.
<P><BR>


<B>Using the DCF</B><BR>
A Java applet can utilize the Allaire Database Component Framework to receive recordsets in two ways:
<OL>
<LI><B>PARAM Initialization</B>. Upon construction the applet can read data specified in an HTML page by PARAM 
elements within the APPLET tag. This happens only once during initialization of the applet. This initialization 
is accomplished by constructing an 
<A HREF="allaire.dcf.recordset.AppletParamRecordset.html">AppletParamRecordset</A> object.
<P>
<LI><B>URL Requests</B>. During execution the applet can request data from a URL and read a recordset identified 
in the data returned. Unlike the initialization technique, this method can be used multiple times 
during the lifetime of an applet's execution. The request is made by passing a URL to the 
<A HREF="allaire.dcf.recordset.Query.html">Query</A> constructor and calling the 
<A HREF="allaire.dcf.recordset.Query.html#execute">execute</A> method.

<P>
</OL>
In either case the DCF will need to be given names for each column and a name to associate with each recordset 
if there are multiple recordsets. The 
<A HREF="allaire.dcf.recordset.Recordset.html#getColumnNames">getColumnNames</A>, 
<A HREF="allaire.dcf.recordset.Recordset.html#getRowCount">getRowCount</A>, and 
<A HREF="allaire.dcf.recordset.Recordset.html#getData">getData</A> methods can be used on the 
resulting 
<A HREF="allaire.dcf.recordset.Recordset.html">recordset(s)</A> to obtain the data.
<P><BR>

<B>Beta 1 Release Notes</B><BR>
All the DCF class reference files (those found in the <I>Docs</I> directory) should be copied 
into the directory where you keep the Java SDK reference. All graphics found in the <I>Images</I> 
subdirectory should be copied to the Java SDK reference subdirectory of the same name.
<P>

CASE-SENSITIVITY - Java is case-sensitive. Thus, 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>&lt;PARAM NAME="<FONT COLOR=RED>Columns</FONT>" VALUE="ID,Height,Weight"&gt;</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
is not the same as 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>&lt;PARAM NAME="<FONT COLOR=RED>COLUMNS</FONT>" VALUE="ID,Height,Weight"&gt;</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
In the event that an expected parameter or keyword (e.g. "Columns" or "Recordset") is not found, the 
AppletParamRecordset will attempt to look for simple case variations (e.g., "Columns", "COLUMNS", and "columns"), but exhaustive case checking (2^NameLength attempts) is not performed. 
<P>

URL ENCODING - Text should be URL encoded if it is going to be used in a list of columns or rows. 
The Cold Fusion function, URLEncodedFormat(), is designed for such use. 
If the data is not URL encoded, and it contains non-alphanumeric data, the DCF might not interpret 
the results correctly.
<P>

NULLS - Null and empty items should be sent as empty strings enclosed within single quotes. For 
example:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Record1,<FONT COLOR=RED>''</FONT>,Record3</BLOCKQUOTE>
instead of the unquoted version:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Record1,,Record3</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
