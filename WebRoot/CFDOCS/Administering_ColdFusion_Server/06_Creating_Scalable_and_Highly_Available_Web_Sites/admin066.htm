 <H1>Introducing ClusterCATS for ColdFusion</H1>



<p>ClusterCATS for ColdFusion is a Web server clustering technology that provides load balancing and failover services that assure high availability for your Web server and ColdFusion Server (CFS). ClusterCATS lets you cluster distributed servers into a single, high-performance, highly available environment of Web server resources.</p><p>A cluster consists of two or more Web servers located on a LAN or across a WAN. Web servers included in a cluster operate as a single entity to provide rapid and reliable access to resources on those Web servers. A cluster can help your Web site avoid the consequences of busy and failed servers -- slow networks. With ClusterCATS you can avoid bandwidth, latency, and congestion problems. </p><p>This section addresses the following topics:</p><ul>

<H2>ClusterCATS for ColdFusion Features</H2>
<p>The ClusterCATS technology embedded in ColdFusion Enterprise provides robust features for load balancing and failing over servers.</p><p>This section describes the following ClusterCATS' features:</p><ul>
<a name="1171023"> </a>
<li><a href="../06_Creating_Scalable_and_Highly_Available_Web_Sites/admin066.htm#1086786">&quot;New clustering features available with ColdFusion v4.5&quot;</a>

<li><a href="../06_Creating_Scalable_and_Highly_Available_Web_Sites/admin066.htm#1072257">&quot;Failover features&quot;</a>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="1086786"></a>
 
<H3>New clustering features available with ColdFusion v4.5</H3>
<p>ColdFusion Enterprise v4.5 includes these new ClusterCATS features:</p><ul>
<a name="1083253"> </a>
<li>Additional Platform Support

<p>ClusterCATS now supports server clusters on the Linux operating system as well 
as Windows NT and Sun Solaris.
</p><a name="1083282"> </a>
</li>
<li>Additional Web Server Support
<p>ClusterCATS now supports the Apache Web Server for hosting UNIX-based 
server clusters in addition Netscape Enterprise Server.
</p><a name="1203224"> </a>
</li>
<li>Automated System Configuration Check (NT/IIS Only)
<p>Performs various system checks to ensure that your Windows NT/IIS Web 
servers are configured properly for use with ClusterCATS. This capability 
checks for the existence of multiple NICs, whether the Streams Environment is 
installed and configured correctly, and whether the All Unassigned setting for 
IP address assumption on failover is configured.
</p><a name="1083272"> </a>
</li>
<li>ColdFusion Probe
<p>Provides another level of ColdFusion-specific load balancing by actively 
monitoring the ColdFusion Server for failures via application probes that you 
create to periodically test a ColdFusion URL on your site. If the Probe's 
validation test fails, it restricts the Web server on which the site resides and 
redirects the restricted server's HTTP traffic to another server in the cluster. This 
new feature extends ClusterCATS' automatic monitoring and failover 
capability.
</p><a name="1201585"> </a>
</li>
<li>Tighter Integration with Cisco LocalDirector
<p>ClusterCATS is now able to provide the availability and load balancing data it 
acquires directly to a Cisco LocalDirector so that the LocalDirector can route 
inbound HTTP traffic to the most appropriate Web server in your cluster.
</p></li>
</ul>
<a name="1116886"></a>
 
<H3>Important ease-of-use features</H3>
<p>These ClusterCATS features make creating and managing your server clusters easy, fast, and secure:</p><ul>
<a name="1116902"> </a>
<li>Graphical Administration Utilities

<p>The Windows-based Explorer allows you to centrally administer NT or UNIX 
clusters easily and quickly. If you run a UNIX-only environment and do not 
have a Windows machine (NT, 98, or 95) on which to install the Windows-based 
Explorer, you can use the Web-based ClusterCATS Explorer together with 
included server utilities to administer your cluster members. 
</p><div>
<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30"><strong>Note	</strong></td>
<td>The Web-based Explorer does not contain all of the configuration 
and administration features found in the Windows-based Explorer. 
See <a href="../06_Creating_Scalable_and_Highly_Available_Web_Sites/admin0613.htm#1133296">&quot;Using the ClusterCATS Web Explorer&quot;</a> for details.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<br><p>The ClusterCATS Server Administrator lets you perform maintenance and 
troubleshooting tasks on each server in your cluster. These tasks include 
putting a server into maintenance mode so that you can update software or 
content, stopping and starting the ClusterCATS service, and adding and 
removing the ClusterCATS filter from the Web server service.
</p><a name="1116944"> </a>
</li>
<li>Cluster Administration Security
<p>ClusterCATS provides three administrator security levels that you can configure 
for the appropriate level of security within your organization.
</p><a name="1116957"> </a>
</li>
<li>Offline Maintenance Support (Windows NT only)
<p>ClusterCATS lets you configure an additional IP address for each Windows 
server in your cluster so that you can perform update and server maintenance 
tasks without removing the server from the cluster or disconnecting it from the 
network
</p></li>
</ul>
<a name="1209245"></a>
 
<H3>Load balancing features</H3>
<p>ClusterCATS provides the following load balancing features:</p><ul>
<a name="1161541"> </a>
<li>Load Threshold Configuration

<p>ClusterCATS lets you configure maximum and gradual redirection thresholds 
for each server in a cluster. The maximum threshold indicates the point at 
which the server cannot handle any additional load. To prevent a server's load 
from reaching this point and resulting in poor performance and unavailability, 
you can also configure a gradual redirection threshold that will redirect 
requests to a less loaded server when the load reaches the gradual redirection 
setting.
</p><a name="1071559"> </a>
</li>
<li>Application-Aware Load Balancing
<p>ClusterCATS ensures that your ColdFusion applications always remain up and 
running because it understands the load algorithm produced by the 
ColdFusion Server (CFS). Consequently, ClusterCATS can redirect HTTP 
requests to other Web servers as necessary in response to increases in load 
hitting the CFS. Additionally, the new configurable ColdFusion Probe provides 
another level of ColdFusion-specific load balancing by detecting whether the 
ColdFusion Server is operating properly. If it determines that the ColdFusion 
Server has failed or is otherwise unavailable, it redirects traffic to another 
available server and attempts to recover the failed ColdFusion Server.
</p><a name="1071564"> </a>
</li>
<li>Session-Aware Load Balancing
<p>This feature ensures that your e-commerce applications maintain their state 
when users are in the process of shopping, ordering, or paying for their 
purchases. Sometimes referred to as a &quot;sticky&quot; session, session-aware load 
balancing guarantees that users won't get bumped from the server on which 
they started their transaction until the transaction is complete, regardless of the 
load thresholds that have been defined for the affected server.
</p><a name="1071565"> </a>
</li>
<li>Hardware Load Balancing Device Integration
<p>ClusterCATS for ColdFusion can augment an existing hardware-based load 
balancing solution by easily integrating with established devices, such as 
Cisco's LocalDirector. Consequently, you are able to take advantage of 
ClusterCATS built-in intelligence, resulting in a more comprehensive load 
balancing solution.
</p></li>
</ul>
<a name="1072257"></a>
 
<H3>Failover features</H3>
<p>ClusterCATS provides these important failover features:</p><ul>
<a name="1072259"> </a>
<li>Continuous IP Monitoring Within Clusters

<p>The ClusterCATS IP monitoring service is a self-monitoring capability that 
enables cluster members to listen for server failures within clusters. Each server 
that is up and running transmits an IP signal, which indicates that the server is 
available and functioning normally. However, if a server fails, it will no longer 
transmit a signal, which indicates to the remaining servers that it is no longer 
available to respond to HTTP requests.
</p><a name="1072403"> </a>
</li>
<li>Automatic IP Address Assumption and HTTP Redirection on Failure
<p>If a server within a cluster fails or becomes unavailable and is no longer 
transmitting an IP signal, another available server in the cluster will 
automatically assume the IP address of the failed server. Subsequent HTTP 
requests that are bound for the downed server will be redirected to the server 
that has taken over for its failed counterpart. When the failed server is fixed and 
comes back online, the server that has assumed the failed server's IP address 
relinquishes it to the fixed server. This process is known as IP aliasing.
</p><a name="1072485"> </a>
</li>
<li>Automatic Administrator Notification
<p>ClusterCATS lets you configure automatic e-mail-based alarms for a wide range 
of failure types. This feature ensures that you can attend to failed servers 
quickly and minimize server downtime. During regular business hours, you can 
scan and read your e-mail as usual. For off-hour periods, you can configure 
your pager to receive e-mail notifications for 24x7 notification capability.
</p></li>
