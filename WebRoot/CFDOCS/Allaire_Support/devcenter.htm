<h1>Allaire Developer Resources</H1>

<p>Welcome to the worldwide community of Allaire developers! From the moment you install our software to the day you launch your site - and beyond - Allaire's services organization is ready to help. Your success is important to Allaire. We've dedicated substantial resources to Professional Services, investing heavily to build the worldwide resources, the support infrastructure and the partner relationships to keep you and your team moving ahead through each phase of the development process.
</P>

<h2>Allaire Developer's Exchange</H2>

<p>The Allaire Developer's Exchange is an online self-service library that allows visitors to view, contribute, and download multiple types of content, and allows contributors password access to administer their contributions. Sections currently include:</P>

<blockquote>

<h4>Custom Tags</h4>

<P>Custom Tags can be used to provide a tag-based wrapper around anything in the ColdFusion universe - including client-side HTML, Java and JavaScript, all of CF's native server-side interfaces (QUERY, LDAP, POP, etc.), and any external server-side code (through CFHTTP, CFOBJECT and CFAPI). Common uses of Custom Tags include Utilities & Functions, UI Components, Business Rules Components, Intelligent Agents, and Application API's.<br>

<h4>Applications</h4>

<p>ColdFusion Web applications provide a wide range of solutions for e-commerce, interactive publishing, business systems, and collaborative computing. If you have a commercial Web application, please enter your information here.<br>

<h4>Web Content</H4>

<p>No one builds a Web site with text alone. We've created a new section in the Developer's Exchange to help you share the content you're most proud of. If you've created (or host a site that maintains) fonts, custom button images, audio, graphics, style sheets, animation, applets or JavaScripts, feel free to load in a subset of your content here and highlight your wares to your colleagues. If you're looking for something to add to your own pages, please stop in and take a look around.<br>
<a href="http://www.allaire.com/Developer/gallery.cfm">http://www.allaire.com/Developer/gallery.cfm</a></P>

<h4>Visual Tools</H4>

<p>Visual Tools are components that are used to extend the Homesite and Cold Fusion Studio development environment. This category includes such things as Snippets, Custom Dialogs/Tag Editors (VTML), Tag Insight Additions, Toolbars, Color Palettes, Templates, Add-In Help, and Guides.<br>
<a href="http://www.allaire.com/Developer/gallery.cfm">http://www.allaire.com/Developer/gallery.cfm</a></P>

<h4>Java (Applets & Servlets)</H4>

<p>Java can be used to build and extend your web applications.  Java servlets are components that can be used to extend the functionality of your Web server.  Servlets are capable of retrieving data from various sources (including databases and file systems) and rendering the data as HTML or XML for your web clients. Java Applets can be used to expand the capabilities of the Web pages your clients read. Applets allow web-browsers to display complex and interactive controls (such as trees and tables) that are not available using standard HTML technologies.<br>
